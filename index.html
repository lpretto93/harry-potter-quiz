            As part of your entry into Hogwarts, we would like to invite you to participate in an exclusive Admission Test to assess your knowledge of the history of our magical world.

We believe that your performance on this test will be a testament to your dedication and readiness to embark on your magical education.

            We wish you the best of luck, and we look forward to seeing you in the Great Hall on the first day of term!
