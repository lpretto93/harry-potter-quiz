        <h2>Thank you for your participation!</h2>
        <p>
            Dear <span id="signature">__________</span>,<br><br>
            We are absolutely thrilled to have you as part of the Hogwarts family. Your acceptance into our prestigious institution marks the beginning of an incredible journey filled with magic, learning, and endless possibilities. As you embark on your first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, you will discover not only the wonders of magic but also the camaraderie of your fellow students and the invaluable lessons that only Hogwarts can provide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the years, you will be trained in the ancient arts of spellcasting, potion-making, and the study of magical creatures. You will also have the opportunity to delve deep into the rich history of the Wizarding World and its many secrets, which have been passed down through generations. But be warned: not all is as it seems at Hogwarts. Dark forces lurk, and it will be up to you and your friends to uncover the mysteries that will shape your destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you can begin your magical studies, however, we must ask you to complete a short knowledge test. This will help us assess your understanding of the history of Hogwarts and the wizarding world. The test is crucial for us to place you in the appropriate house and guide you in your magical journey. Do not be afraid; the test is designed to be both fun and informative, allowing you to showcase your potential.
        </p>
        <p>We look forward to seeing your results and welcoming you officially to Hogwarts!</p>
